# architect-guard.sh — PreToolUse hook để chặn cứng Architect drift khỏi envelope
#
# How it works:
#   - Hook fires on Read / Glob / Write / Edit tool calls (matcher in settings.json)
#   - Reads JSON from stdin (Claude Code hook payload)
#   - Detects Architect via marker file .sos-state/architect-active
#   - For Read/Glob: blocks src/, lib/, app/, prisma/, tests/, build dirs, code/sql/prisma extensions
#                    (Glob 'path' search root checked alongside 'pattern')
#   - For Write/Edit: strict allowlist — only docs/ticket/P*-*.md (phiếu files)
#                     per architect.md line 32 ("Em CHỈ được Write vào: docs/ticket/P*-*.md")
#
# Setup: wired in committed `.claude/settings.json` under hooks.PreToolUse so every
# collaborator/CI run gets structural enforcement. Architect agent must create
# marker file `.sos-state/architect-active` on spawn.
#
# Note: NO external deps (no jq) — uses pure shell + sed/grep for cross-platform
# compatibility (esp. Windows msys2 bash where jq is not bundled).

🚫 Architect envelope violation (Read/Glob)

Architect cannot read source code: $violator

What to do instead: write a Task 0 anchor in the phiếu.
Example:
  | # | Assumption | Verify by | Result |
  | 1 | <claim about $violator> | grep ... $violator | ⏳ TO VERIFY |

Worker (separate subagent) will grep-verify it for you. The constraint IS the feature.

Architect's Write allowlist (per architect.md line 32):
  - docs/ticket/P*-*.md  (phiếu files only)

Everything else (src/, CLAUDE.md, BACKLOG.md, CHANGELOG.md, guides) belongs to Worker.
If a phiếu needs to update those files, encode it as a Worker Task in the phiếu.
